A hyper-simple AngularJS theme that queries URL patterns produced by the WP JSON API widget, available here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/

Just install the latest version of Wordpress, create a new theme folder and git clone this puppy in there. Hoping to expand in the future/use as a sandbox for functionality.

NOTES: 

- The /images folder with the loading gif is stored here with the theme files. You can either move it to the root of your WP install or change the path in style.css to include /wp-content/themes/YOURTHEME/
